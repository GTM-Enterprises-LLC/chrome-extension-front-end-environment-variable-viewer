## [3.1.0] - 2026-01-13

### 🎉 New Framework Support

**Vue, Svelte, and Angular** - The extension now fully supports detecting environment variables from these popular frameworks:

- **Vue 3 (Vite)**: Detects `VITE_` prefixed variables in Vue applications
- **Svelte (Vite)**: Detects `VITE_` prefixed variables in Svelte applications
- **Angular**: Detects environment object properties (apiUrl, apiKey, etc.)

### ✨ New Features

- Added test demo apps for Vue, Svelte, and Angular
- Added Docker support for all new demo apps
- Enhanced test-extension.js to validate detection across all 8 frameworks
- Added Angular-specific pattern detection for environment objects

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed false positive NODE_ENV detection**: Pattern 10 was too aggressive and matched any occurrence of "production", "development", or "test" in quotes. Now only matches actual NODE_ENV assignments.
- **Fixed long env var key wrapping**: Environment variable keys now use `text-overflow: ellipsis` instead of wrapping to multiple lines

### 🔧 Improvements

- Made NODE_ENV detection more strict - only matches explicit assignments like `NODE_ENV="production"`
- Updated docker-compose.yml with 6 new services (Vue dev/prod, Svelte dev/prod, Angular dev/prod)
- Improved popup.css to handle long variable names elegantly with ellipsis
- Added Angular environment property detection (apiUrl, apiKey, production, etc.)

### 📚 Documentation

- Test suite now covers 8 frameworks: React, Vite, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Multicloud, Payment APIs
- Updated test cases with proper port mappings (8081, 8082, 8083 for prod builds)

## [3.0.0] - 2026-01-13

### 🎉 Major Features

**Hardcoded Secret Detection** - The extension now detects hardcoded sensitive credentials and API keys that should never be in frontend code:

- **AWS Keys**: Detects `AKIA...` access keys and 40-character secret keys
- **Stripe Keys**: Detects `sk_live_`, `pk_live_`, `sk_test_`, `pk_test_` patterns
- **Google API Keys**: Detects `AIza...` keys
- **UUIDs**: Detects UUID patterns (common in tokens)
- **Generic API Keys**: Detects long alphanumeric strings (32+ chars) with entropy

### ✨ New Features

- Added `🔐 Secrets` filter button to quickly view detected hardcoded secrets
- Visual warning banner when secrets are detected
- Pattern 15: Name-value pair detection for credential displays
- Pattern 16-21: Specific patterns for AWS, Stripe, Google, and generic API keys
- Improved Vite environment variable detection with name-value pairs

### 🔧 Improvements

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading to 3.0.0

**New Feature: Secret Detection**

The extension now automatically detects hardcoded secrets. To use:

1. Reload the extension in Chrome
2. Visit any web page
3. Click the 🔐 Secrets filter to see detected secrets
4. A warning banner appears if secrets are found

**Breaking Changes:** None - this is backward compatible

**Recommended Actions:**
- Review any detected secrets in your applications
- Move sensitive credentials to backend services
- Use environment variables only for non-sensitive configuration
